						\chapter{Conclusion}

This is the conclusion, it concludes the paper.


% we have provided insight into many of hte dtails of
% we described our implementation of
% since it is simple to detect non-manifold, we also provided a method
% nexxt our data structres
% finally we provided a technique for inserting

% we have described work in computational geometry motivated by
% this material spans a
% we beleive the worthwile research is spread
