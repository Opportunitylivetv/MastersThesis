This paper provides several contributions related to the workpiece drainability problem in manufacturing. First we describe our parametric approach to a particle model that uses parabolic path segments rather than straight-line segments. This improvement allows for particles to maintain velocity, travel through rotating acceleration fields, and collide with workpiece surfaces while maintaining constant-time geometric primitive intersecton tests.

Next we provide a framework for approaching the drainability problem from an artificial intelligence perspective. We define our state space formulation and note how the size of the state space is linear with geometric features. We then define our sampling approach to the successor function which produces information on the connectivity between vertices of the workpiece.

Finally, we describe how to obtain both a solution to a given draining problem and the full control sequence of the workpiece rotator, the latter of which is immediately applicable in industry.
