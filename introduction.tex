The key obstacle for manufacturers is both to analyze the ``drainability'' of a workpiece and produce a series of actions that will fully drain the workpiece.

Drainability in this sense refers to the ability for a part to be fully drained by rotations about a particular axis. Existing work has made great progress in this domain; Yasui et all's work is capable of producing a map of which rotation axes would fully drain the part under an infinite number of rotations. These results can be quite useful when designing rotation fixtures or altering the geometry of a workpiece.

More progress is needed in the domain of producing a series of actions that would drain the part. This work aims to produce those useful results. (probably more here)
